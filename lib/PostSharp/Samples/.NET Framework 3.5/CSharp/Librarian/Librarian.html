<h1>Librarian Sample: a complete application</h1>

<p>The <code>PostSharp.Samples.Librarian</code> solution is a complete
application that illustrates the use of PostSharp Laos and compile-time
code generation for a real-world project. The application is written
using the layered architecture style and has two executables: a
command-line server and a WinForms client. Both parts communicate using
.NET Remoting.</p>
<p>For more information about this application, please read the ReadMe.txt files located in each project of this solution.</p>
