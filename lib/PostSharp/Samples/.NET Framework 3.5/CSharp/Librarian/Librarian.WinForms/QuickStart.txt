Overview
---------

This sample application is a business software for library management.

Functional features:

- Customers + Customer Account (rentals are prepaid)

- Book Rentals : open, return, book lost -- notes on rentals

- Cashbox (to accept customer payments)


Non-functional features:

- Transactional object database (yes, really!) relying on .NET Serialization,
  whose most amazing feature is the lack of support of indexes 
  (everything is in memory and every search has linear complexity!)

- Separation of business entities, business processes, business rules, storage
  and user interface
  
- SOA style: the user interface composes messages using entity classes but access
  the resources only through business processes. (Changing entity properties does
  not change the underlying model; it affects only the message to which it belongs).



Building the PostSharp.Samples.Librarian Sample
-----------------------------

Be sure to have PostSharp 1.0 (build >= 166) installed before building the solution.
Visual C# Express and Visual Studio 2005 are OK.



Running the sample
-------------------

The application creates a data directory in a folder named "data" and located in the
same directory as the executable (PostSharp.Samples.Librarian.exe).

An employee (you, the user) and a cashbox are automatically created.

In order to test the functionalities, you have to:

1. Create a customer
2. Accept a payment from this customer
3. Create a book
4. Create a rental
5. Return the book or report it as lost.



Further documentation
---------------------

Each namespace contains a 'ReadMe.txt' file.
