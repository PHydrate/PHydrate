<h1>Object Composition Sample</h1>

<span class="openfloat"><a href="PostSharp.Samples.Composition.sln"><img src="../vs.png" border="0" alt="">Open this sample in Visual Studio</a> </span>

<p>The <code>PostSharp.Samples.Composition</code>
project demonstrates the use of PostSharp Laos to compose objects.</p>



<p>What is object composition? Say you want to implement a
collection (<code>ICollection</code>)
based on an <code>ArrayList</code>, but you want to hide <code>ArrayList</code>
and don't want to implement each method manually. PostSharp can do it
for you. Look at the following code sample:</p>



<pre> [SimpleComposition( typeof(ArrayList), typeof(ICollection))]<br> class SampleCollection<br> {<br> // Optionally add some methods here.<br> }<br></pre>



<p>After processing by PostSharp, the <code>SampleCollection</code>
class will implement the <code>ICollection</code> method
based on the <code>ArrayList</code> implementation.</p>



<h2>Implementing the Composition Attribute</h2>

<p>The functionality of composing an object into another is provided by
the Composition Aspect. All we have to do in our sample is,
conceptually, to give parameters to this Composition Aspects. That is,
we have to tell which interface has to be composed, and which
implementation object has to be used. Both types are the arguments of
our custom attribute.</p>

<p>So what we have to do is finally really easy: we create a class <code>SimpleCompositionAttribute</code> derived from <code>CompositionAspect</code>, we add a constructor with two parameters, and we override the <code>GetPublicInterface</code> and <code>CreateImplementationObject</code> methods. Because we need to create an instance of the implementation class (<code>ArrayList</code> in the sample use case here above), we have to require the implementation class to have a default constructor.</p>

<p>A minor issue appears: how to serialize both interface and implementation type names? We cannot simply serialize the <code>Type</code> instance, because it is not safely serializable. So we will store the type names in the class.</p>

<pre>[Serializable]<br>public sealed class SimpleCompositionAttribute : CompositionAspect<br>{<br>    // Name of the type of the composed object.<br>    string implementationTypeName;<br><br>    // Name of the exposed interface.<br>    string interfaceTypeName;<br><br>    public SimpleCompositionAttribute(Type interfaceType, Type implementationType)<br>    {<br>        if (implementationType != null)<br>        {<br>            this.implementationTypeName = implementationType.FullName;<br>        }<br><br>        if (interfaceType != null)<br>        {<br>            this.interfaceTypeName = interfaceType.FullName;<br>        }<br><br>    }<br><br>    public override object CreateImplementationObject(InstanceBoundLaosEventArgs eventArgs)<br>    {<br>        return Activator.CreateInstance(
            GenericArg.Map( this.ImplementationType, 
            eventArgs.Instance.GetType().GetGenericArguments(), null));<br>    }<br><br>    public override Type GetPublicInterface(Type containerType)<br>    {<br>        return GenericArg.Map( this.InterfaceType, containerType.GetGenericArguments(), null );<br>    }<br><br>}<br></pre>

<p>If you have been attentive, you have noticed the call to <code>GenericArg.Map</code>. What is it?</p>

<p>Well, we have been a little more ambitious. We want to be able to
compose generic classes. For instance, we want to do able to do this:</p>

<pre>[SimpleComposition(typeof(IList&lt;GenericTypeArg0&gt;), typeof(List&lt;GenericTypeArg0&gt;))]<br>class SimpleList&lt;T&gt; <br>{ <br>}</pre>

<p>Note that we have use the type <code>GenericTypeArg0</code>. This is a 'magic type' meaning that you refer to the first generic type argument in the current context, that is, <code>T</code> in our example.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <code>GenericArg.Map</code> method is precisely to resolve this 'magic type'.</p>

<p>It smells like a hack, but in fact it is much cleaner than its
appear. We give a general mechanism to provide unbound generic
parameters and a method to bind them to their context.</p>

<h2>Using the Composition Attribute</h2>

<p>We've already given two examples of how to define a composed class. But how to use these classes?</p>

<p>Since the new interface is added <i>after</i> compilation, you will
not see the methods of this interface using IntelliSense and your
program won't even compile if you reference them. Instead, you should
explicitly cast the class. And to avoid your compiler complaining that
the class cannot be casted to this interface, you first have to cast to
<code>object</code>.</p>

<pre>IList&lt;string&gt; list = (IList&lt;string&gt;)(object)new SimpleList&lt;string&gt;();<br><br>list.Add("dog");<br>list.Add("cat");<br>list.Add("cow");</pre>
