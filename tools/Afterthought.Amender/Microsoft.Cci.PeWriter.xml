            <summary>
            Fills in stringIndexMap with data from stringIndex and write to stringWriter.  
            Releases stringIndex as the stringTable is sealed after this point.

            <summary>
            returns a multiple 4 that is at least 12 and at most 256 and that is just big enough to hold the version string.

            <summary>
            Returns a reference to the unit that defines the given referenced type. If the referenced type is a structural type, such as a pointer or a generic type instance,
